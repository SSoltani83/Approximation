# Numerical Integration Methods: Midpoint, Trapezoidal and Simpson's rule of approximation
 This C++ Program demonstrates how the Midpoint, Trapezoidal and Simpson's numerical integration methods work.
 The integrated function f(x) must be hard coded in the main_source.cpp file. No parsler is provided at this time. 
 The User is also required to make three inputs: the lower and upper bounds of integration and the maximum number of iteration allowed.
 The tolerance error is defined as a macro in the main_source.cpp file and is equivalent to 5e-7.
 When compiled, this program displays the result of each method at each iteration.
