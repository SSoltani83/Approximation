# Approximation
This C++ Program demonstrates how The Midpoint, Trapezoidal and Simpson's numerical integration methods work.
The User is required to make three inputs: the lower and upper bounds of integration and the maximum number of allowed iterations.
‚å†f(x)dx the function under the integral must be hard coded in the main_source.cpp file. No parsler is provided with this program.
This program then outputs the results of each iteration or mesh on the screen.
